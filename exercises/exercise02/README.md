## Login Using the CLI
Set the api target with:
```
cf api https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com
```
then login using `cf login`. Enter the details as provided during registration.

Enter then the command `cf target`. This command displays the default organization and space for your account. In case of multiple organizations, it allows you to set a default organization (`-o`) and space (`-s`) within the organization.
